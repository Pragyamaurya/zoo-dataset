# zoo-dataset


Overview

The Zoo dataset contains information about different animal species, classified based on various characteristics. The dataset is useful for classification tasks and machine learning models related to animal taxonomy.

Dataset Information

Total Entries: 101

Total Features: 18 (1 categorical, 17 numerical/binary)

Target Variable: The last column likely represents the classification of the animal.

Column Descriptions

Animal Name (String): The name of the animal.

Attribute Columns (Binary/Numeric): Various features representing characteristics of the animal, such as:

Whether the animal is a mammal

Whether it has feathers

Whether it lays eggs

Whether it can fly

Whether it lives in water

Number of legs

Class Label: The classification of the animal (e.g., mammal, bird, fish, etc.).

Usage

This dataset can be used for:

Classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)

Feature engineering and data preprocessing tasks

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

How to Use

Load the dataset using Pandas:

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('zoo.data', header=None)

Perform basic EDA:

print(df.info())
print(df.head())

Preprocess data by encoding categorical variables and normalizing features if required.
